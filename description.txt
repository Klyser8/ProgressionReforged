A mod which focus is to rework the progression of the game, giving purpose to more items and bosses found within Terraria. 
To do this, the mod tweaks hundreds of items, adds new ones to fill in gaps in progression. 
The tweaks include recipe changes, item reworks, reforge changes, and more.
DISCLAIMER: This mod is built to be played alongside Terraria Overhaul. It can be played without it, but I cannot guarantee a balanced experience.
